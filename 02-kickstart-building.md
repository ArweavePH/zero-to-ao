# ðŸš€ Week 2: Kickstarting Development

## ðŸŽ¯ **Theme:** _From Idea to Execution_

## âœ… **Key Focus Areas**

- Define project **structure** and **milestones**.
- Assess project **feasibility** for a hackathon timeframe.
- Select the best **AO-specific tech stack** for development.
- Start working on the **core functionality**.
- Understand and implement **AO-specific best practices**.
- Establish clear **collaboration workflows** if working in a team.

## ðŸ“Œ **Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Structuring Your Project**

- Choose your development **stack**:
  - **Frontend UI:** Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte
  - **Backend API:** Node.js
  - **Smart Contracts:** AO processes (Lua), CPP for more complex processes

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips:**

- If you're using Next.js, consider using [ArNext](https://github.com/weavedb/arnext/tree/master), a NextJS-based framework that lets you deploy the same codebase both on Vercel and Arweave.
- Break your development into **chunks**â€”start with small, independent components before integrating them into larger sections and full pages. This approach prevents overwhelm and makes debugging easier.
- Keep documentation updated while building. This helps maintain clarity and smooth collaboration, especially for hackathon teams.

### **Step 2: Understanding AO Development Essentials**

- Learn how to:
  - Use **AOâ€™s messaging system** for inter-process communication.
  - Deploy **AO processes** and interact with them.
  - Manage **AO process states and memory** efficiently.
  - Implement **AO caching and data persistence best practices**.
  - Refer to the **AO Developer Documentation** ([insert link here]).

### **Step 3: Visualizing and Drawing Your Architecture & User Flow**

- Create a **high-level architecture diagram** to map out components and interactions.
- Define your **user flow**â€”how a user interacts with your system step-by-step.
- Identify **core AO processes** and where they fit into the design.
- Use tools like:
  - [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for quick sketches.
  - [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for detailed workflows.
  - Hand-drawn sketches are fine tooâ€”just ensure clarity!

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips:**

- Keep the architecture **modular**â€”separate concerns so each component can be developed independently.
- Design with **scalability** in mindâ€”how will your system handle increased usage?
- Get **early feedback** on your architecture before deep diving into code.

### **Step 4: Building the First Core Feature with AO**

- Start with the **most essential AO functionality**.
- Use **AOConnect** for frontend integration ([AOConnect Guide](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.dev/guides/aoconnect/aoconnect.html)).
- Utilize **Turbo-SDK** for efficient **file uploads & storage** ([Turbo-SDK Guide](https://cookbook.arweave.dev/guides/posting-transactions/turbo.html)).
- See other ["bonus topics"](https://github.com/ArweavePH/balangay-roadshow/tree/main/04-bonus-topics) at the Balangay Repo to know which tech you can use.
- Implement **logging and AO-specific debugging mechanisms** ([Error Handling Guide](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.dev/guides/aos/modules/ao.html#examples)).
  - Test core features in isolation before integrating them into the full system. This ensures stability and easier debugging.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips:**

- Validate user interactions earlyâ€”getting quick feedback prevents costly rework later.
- Do not optimize too early! Focus on building core features for MVP.

### **Step 5: Troubleshooting AO-Specific Blockers**

- Document AO-specific blockers in **GitHub Issues**.
- Ask for help in the **AO Discord & Office Hours**.
- Debugging strategies:
  - Use **AO process logs** to trace execution issues.
  - Test AO process interactions using **dry-run mode**.
  - Utilize **mock AO processes** before handling live transactions.
  - Refer to the [**Common AO Debugging Issues Guide**](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.dev/guides/aos/troubleshooting.html).

### **Step 6: Deployment & AO Testing**

- Implement **unit tests & integration tests** for AO-specific functionality ([AO Testing Guide](https://github.com/weavedb/wao)).
- Deploy your **lua code** to an AO process ([AO Deployment Guide](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.dev/guides/aos/load.html#load)).
