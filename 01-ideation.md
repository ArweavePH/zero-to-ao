# 🏗 Week 1: Ideation & Project Planning

### 🎯 **Goal:** Shift from learning to active project development with a focus on **hackathon readiness**.

### 🔥 **Theme:** _Commitment to winning future AO Hackathons_

## ✅ **Key Objectives**

1. Define your project concept and set **clear, achievable milestones**.
2. Shift from a **learner’s mindset** to an **action-oriented approach**.
3. Form teams (if needed) and refine **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** ideas.
4. Understand **AO Mainnet capabilities** and how to leverage them.
5. Learn **hackathon strategies** for managing time effectively.

## 📌 **Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Understanding AO Mainnet Capabilities**

- Read the latest **AO Mainnet Documentation** via [AO Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.ph/).
- Finish Lessons 1-4 at the [Balangay Roadshow Repo](https://github.com/arweaveph/balangay-roadshow)
- Learn about:
  - AO's **Hyperparallel Supercomputer**
  - AO Message Flow & Holographic State
- Join the **AO Discord** and follow updates on mainnet deployment.

### **Step 2: Brainstorming Your Project Idea**

- Explore project ideas from our curated list: [AO Project Ideas](https://github.com/ArweavePH/ao-project-ideas)
- Ask yourself:
  - What problem am I solving? What are the current problems in society? Am I experiencing a personal pain point in my everyday life?
  - How does AO’s unique architecture help me solve it better?
  - Can I build this within a hackathon timeframe (2-4 weeks)?
- **Idea Validation:**
  - Research similar projects. If there's an existing project, don't waver, it just means there's a pain point to be solved and a market to serve.
  - Discuss with mentors and peers in **weekly office hours**.

### **Step 3: Defining Your MVP**

- Keep it **simple**: What is the **one core feature** your project must have?
- Remember, having a lot of features is not ideal for MVP. Having everything may also mean having nothing at the same time.
- It helps to visualize or diagram every single feature for the MVP and how it connects.
- Break down your MVP into:
  - **Must-have** – Core functionality.
  - **Should-have** – Enhancements if time allows.
  - **Could-have** – Future improvements.

### **Step 4: Forming or Strengthening Teams**

- If working solo: Ensure your project is **small enough** to be feasible.
- If in a team: Assign roles (Frontend, Backend, Smart Contract, UX/UI).
- Leverage **AO Builders Circle** for potential team members.

### **Step 5: Setting Weekly Milestones**

| Week | Milestone                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Define idea & MVP, set up repo     |
| 2    | Initial development & architecture |
| 3    | First working prototype            |
| 4    | UI/UX improvements, testing        |
| 5    | Finalizing for demo                |
| 6    | Demo & pitch prep                  |
